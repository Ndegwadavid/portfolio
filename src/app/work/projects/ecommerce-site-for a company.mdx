## Overview

Developed a robust e-commerce platform with real-time capabilities, handling concurrent shopping activities across different user sessions. The system integrates shopping cart management, order processing, and inventory control while maintaining fast performance and data consistency during high-traffic shopping periods.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented granular access control with distinct panels for administrators, customer service representatives, inventory managers, and marketing staff. Each role has customized views and permissions aligned with their responsibilities.

- **Real-time Operations**:
  - Built with WebSocket integration for live product and inventory updates
  - Implemented optimistic UI updates with proper rollback mechanisms
  - Real-time notifications for order status and stock levels
  - Live tracking of shopping carts and user interactions

- **Shopping Cart Management**:
  - End-to-end checkout workflow
  - Real-time inventory synchronization
  - Automated pricing and discount calculations
  - Cart status persistence and multi-device sync
  - Integration with payment gateways

- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Comprehensive sales analytics and reporting
  - Product and inventory management
  - System configuration and customization options
  - Audit logs for all critical operations
  - Performance monitoring tools

- **Customer Service Panel**:
  - Order status tracking system
  - Return and refund management
  - Quick access to customer history
  - Order documentation processing
  - Customer communication tools

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Socket.io**: Real-time bi-directional communication
- **Redis**: Caching and cart session management
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with transaction management
- **React Query**: Data synchronization and cache management
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment
- **Material-UI**: Consistent UI components across panels

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included managing concurrent shopping sessions while maintaining inventory accuracy, and implementing real-time features without compromising system performance. The solution involved:

- Implementing optimistic concurrency control
- Using Redis for caching and real-time stock updates
- Setting up proper database indexing and query optimization
- Creating efficient WebSocket channels for different user groups
- Implementing proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Outcome

The system demonstrates impressive performance metrics, including:

- Supporting over a thousand concurrent shoppers
- Maintaining real-time updates with sub-100ms latency
- Processing tens of thousands of daily orders
- Achieving 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- Reducing checkout time by 60%
- Improving customer satisfaction by 40%

The implementation has significantly improved business operations by:

- Streamlining shopping and checkout processes
- Reducing inventory errors through automation
- Providing real-time visibility into sales operations
- Enabling data-driven decision making through comprehensive analytics
- Improving team collaboration through role-specific interfaces
